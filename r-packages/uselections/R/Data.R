#' Voter Party Registration Dataset
#'
#' This dataset contains voter registration by county.
#' In the 30 states plus DC that allow party registration under state law, the registration
#' by party is included in separate fields; in the other states, all voters are tallied under
#' the N=Unaffiliated field.
#'
#' The data in this dataset were sourced from state elections websites.  We have a todo
#' to produce a detailed document listing the data sources.
#'
#' Note: There is considerable variation across states in reporting registration
#' for parties other than Democratic or Republican.  Most states report
#' Green Party and Libertarian, but not all.  Some states report other parties
#' as well.  The "other" variable captures all registrations for parties in
#' that county that are not NA.  That is, if the Green Party has a non-NA
#' value for a county, then the Green Party is not counted in "other" for that
#' county.
#'
#' Note:  Not all states capture No Party or Unaffiliated separately.  If these
#' are reported separately for a state, they are combined in the N variable.
#'
#' This data frame has more rows than PresidentialElectionResults2016 because there are 29 extra annual registration obs for Hawaii (x4 counties = 116 rows)
#' and 5 extra 2016 monthly obs for Arizona (x15 counties = 75 rows).  3141+75+116=3332.

#' Presidential Election Results Dataset (2016)
#'
#' This dataset contains county-level results of the 2016 presidential election.
#'
#' The data in this dataset were sourced from state elections websites, but most were
#' obtained through the intermediary of the Steven Pettigrew dataverse dataset
#' at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MLLQDH.
#'
#' Note: Alaska published results for absentee and early voting by district, not precint.
#' Since districts do not roll up to Boroughs (county equivalents), we allocated these
#' votes to precincts according to the share of each precinct's total ballots within its district, before
#' rolling all Alaska precincts up into their counties.
