Overview
--------

The uselections package provides functionality for loading information about voter registration and election results in the
United States.  The initial goal is to provide data on registration (including party affiliation in states that allow it) as close to the time of the 2016 general election as data are available, as well as 2016 presidential election results. We will iterate on this initial goal to include additional historical data.

We have also added a "County Characteristics" data frame, with interesting explanatory variables that could be useful in visualizing and/or modeling 2016 election results.

Installation
------------

We do not have immediate plans to push the package to CRAN, so you need to install directly from GitHub.  Note that this
will install all dependencies as well.  These dependencies include the rgeos package, which can be a little tricky to
install on some platforms.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Data4Democracy/election-transparency/r-packages/uselections")
```

Usage - States Dataset
----------------------

The package includes a data frame containing some useful state-level variables, including:

* the number of electoral votes allocated to each state based on the 2010 census, applicable to Presidential elections in 2012, 2016, and 2020.
* whether state law allows party affiliation at registration
